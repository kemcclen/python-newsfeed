# Just Tech News

## Description
Just Tech News is an application that enables users to submit tech-related links and provide comments on links shared by other users. The app's backend was refactored from an original Node.js-based version, which was initially developed as part of a tutorial in the U of T Coding Bootcamp Continuation courses.
